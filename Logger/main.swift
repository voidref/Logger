// You can have an action performed any time a category is logged. This can be useful for things like analytics logging via the log interface in order to reduce the dependency on any one analytics library in your application.
// Actions are always called, even for disabled categories.

// The Log.Cat.config category is enabled by default. This is generally for displaying errors in your configuration which would have serious impacts on your appliation's functionality, e.g.: missing resources
// The optional userInfo can be any object, it's only ever passed along to the log actions you have defined.

// Logging a message without enabling the category will result in no output
